# TODO

- move tab bar width and zoom to top bar
- in overview, show currently visible bars in tab view, not only the first
- make overview responsive to height change
  - keep in mind legends have different height (hardcode their heights?)
- make overview scale more controlled, eg do not scale font size
  - scale to max number of bars, currently not correct
- add section labels
- add contributing.md
- add semi-transparent rects to bars that have been added for alignment, to make them less salient
  - does currently not work
- make legend more compact by putting label next to color gradient

## Future

- audio playback
- multi-sequence alignment
