# TODO

- move tab bar width and zoom to top bar
- in overview, show currently visible bars in tab view, not only the first
- make overview responsive to height change, but keep in mind legends have different height
- make overview scale more controlled, eg do not scale font size
- add section labels
- add contributing.md
- add semi-transparent rects to bars that have been added for alignment, to make them less salient
  - does currently not work

## Future

- audio playback
- multi-sequence alignment
